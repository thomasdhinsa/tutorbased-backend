  {user_id: 5, teacher_id: 11, rating: 2, body: "summer was nice but I found her lack of knowledge on certain questions I asked alarming. Mind you, My questions were niche but a teacher should have some of the answers."},
  {user_id: 5, teacher_id: 9, rating: 4, body: "The stern teaching style is somewhat of a dying art and I like the fact that Mr. McGuffin keeps the work structured and learning fairly optimal."},
  {user_id: 5, teacher_id: 8, rating: 3, body: "My experience with Ms. Peppermill was a normal teacher/student exchange. She assigned the work, I completed it and she explained the in betweens. It felt monotonous but effective."},

  {user_id: 14, teacher_id: 13, rating: 3, body: "Being a 160 year old professor myself, I can speak on the topic of education. When I was just a child growing up on my families farm, I invented many things. For one of my inventions to be teaching other humans about the arts is divine. Alas, I can only grade with a rating of three because I am a harsh critic."},
  {user_id: 4, teacher_id: 15, rating: 5, body: "Who wouldn't rate one of the queens of Hogwarts a five. She is charismatic, intelligent, and brazen. She is always willing to sacrifice for others.

  {user_id: 4, teacher_id: 13, rating: 4, body: "When I saw that Bender was teaching botany, I had to rush and book a tutoring session with him. You'd think that due to the fact that he is a robot, he wouldn't be able to feel or be gentle but that is quite untrue. You don't get many opportunities like this in a lifetime so, I sure took it!"}
